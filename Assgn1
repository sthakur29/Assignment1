Need: 
To store and sort the gigantic amounts of data Hadoop comes into play. The processing of these complex forms of data often is not so easy. The data is of different types and forms and often requires extensive processing and implementation, which is not possible without Hadoop.

Working:
Hadoop has two parts- Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) and a a data processing framework.

HDFS is the place to store your data until and when it's needed. 
When something needs to be done with data, Data Processing Framework comes into picture.
